# FLEET — multi-agent solver campaign: roster, stop policy, restart procedure

This file is written and owned by the **coordinator session**, not by any solver agent.
Solver agents must not modify it. It exists so the campaign can be stopped at a session
limit and restarted afterwards without losing work or re-deciding the plan.

## Roster (10 independent solvers)

Every agent: reads `PROMPT.txt` as its mission, re-verifies the 39,026 partial itself,
treats prior lab conclusions as hypotheses, writes only into its own directory, runs no
git commands, and verifies every claimed improvement with `solve_lab/checker.py`.

| Agent | Work dir | Angle |
|-------|----------|-------|
| A | `agentA_work/` | Exact integer linear algebra: HNF / Smith normal form, LLL / BKZ on the lift lattice; retest "39,026 is optimal" under a larger movable-variable set |
| B | `agentB_work/` | Independent re-parse of the raw file; own model, ignoring the lab's atom/gate decomposition |
| C | `agentC_work/` | SAT / SMT / CP / MIP and algebraic solver encodings of the reduced core |
| D | `agentD_work/` | Large-scale stochastic search; fast exact incremental evaluator, parallel tempering / LNS across multiple restart partials |
| E | `agentE_work/` | Structural attack on the 7 failing equations: exact dependency neighborhood, computed free deformation space, simultaneous repair |
| F | `agentF_work/` | p-adic and multi-modular lifting: solve mod many primes, Hensel-lift, CRT-reconstruct |
| G | `agentG_work/` | Relaxation and rounding: homotopy, SDP / moment, MIP relaxations as a compass, exact integer snapping |
| H | `agentH_work/` | Decomposition: dependency graph, separators, treewidth, block DP over a small separator |
| I | `agentI_work/` | Build from scratch rather than repair: complete CDCL-style search, hard variables decided at the top of the tree |
| J | `agentJ_work/` | Attack the reduced parameterization (the claimed thirteen 296-bit numbers); verify it first, then solve directly in that space |

**Forbidden for all agents:** reverse-engineering how the instance file was generated — no
PRNG or coefficient-template forensics, no emission-order or index-ordering forensics aimed
at recovering a generator. Agent E originally held that angle and was redirected; artifacts
it produced under it are withdrawn, not built upon. The equations are to be analyzed as
mathematical objects only.

## Binding limits (measured, not assumed)

| Resource | Measured | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| CPU | 4 cores, 10 agents | **BINDING** — ~2.5x oversubscribed |
| Memory | 15 GB total, ~12 GB available | ample |
| Disk | ~30 GB available; `solve_lab/` ~350 MB | ample |
| Coordinator context | grows with each agent report | the real session limit |

CPU is the near constraint, so agents are compute-starved rather than blocked. That is
acceptable for search-style work but means wall-clock results arrive slower than a 10x
fan-out suggests.

## Stop policy

A stop is *appropriate* only when the agent's work is already durable. Order matters:

1. Send each agent a flush request (`SendMessage`): write its findings to
   `agent<X>_work/LOG.md` and `agent<X>_work/RESUME_<X>.md`, save any verified assignment
   JSON, and report back — within one tool round.
2. Wait for the reports, or for a short grace period.
3. Only then `TaskStop` anything still running.
4. Coordinator commits and pushes all agent directories.
5. Update the "Campaign state" section below.

Never `TaskStop` first: agents hold their best results in context, and an un-flushed stop
discards exactly the work the campaign is for.

Under CPU pressure specifically, prefer **thinning the fleet** over stopping it — stop the
agents whose angle has plateaued and let the rest have the cores.

## Restart procedure (after a limit resets)

1. Read this file, then `RESUME.md` and `STATE.json`.
2. Re-verify the deliverable: `python3 solve_lab/checker.py solve_lab/best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`.
3. For each agent to resume: read its `agent<X>_work/RESUME_<X>.md`, then relaunch a fresh
   agent with the same angle from the roster above, pointing it at that file so it continues
   rather than restarts. Agent work dirs are committed, so a fresh container recovers them
   from the branch.
4. Do not relaunch an angle that reported a definitive dead end — record it under "Retired
   angles" below and spend the core elsewhere.

## Campaign state

- Best verified partial: **39,026 / 39,033**, `best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`,
  failing `[12231, 12270, 12350, 14584, 18673, 22044, 29125]`. **No agent has beaten it.**
- Retired angles: generator inversion (dropped by user instruction, agent E redirected).

### Check-in 1 — fleet thinned 10 → 5

CPU was 5x oversubscribed (load 20 on 4 cores), so five agents were stopped flush-first.
Memory and disk stayed ample. Stopped, each having delivered its angle's result:

| Agent | Why stopped | What it delivered |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| B | angle complete | independent parser + model, 0/39033 mismatches; every eq is `scalar * L^k = 0` |
| E | below baseline (39,015) | clean parse + acyclic DAG, 8,365 free inputs, after losing its first angle |
| G | superseded | exact symbolic forward eval over F_p: 112 symbols, 57 non-constant checks |
| H | decomposition delivered | acyclic frame over all 38,748 vars, 8,747 free inputs — cleaner than prior sessions' |
| J | verdict delivered | reduced parameterization independently re-derived and CONFIRMED real |

### WITHDRAWN BY USER INSTRUCTION — do not resume, do not re-derive

The section below records a reading of the instance that the user has directed the fleet to
drop entirely. All agents have been told to delete its artifacts, purge its vocabulary from
their notes, and not re-derive it. **It is retained here only so a future session recognizes
the direction as closed rather than rediscovering it.** Do not act on it, cite it, or use it
to argue that the instance is unsolvable.

The reason for the change is sound independently of whether the reading was correct: every
agent had begun interpreting every result through a single lens, and that lens was being used
to conclude the instance cannot be solved — which narrowed what anyone was willing to search.
Work the equations as integer polynomials.

Note what survives translation, because it is most of the durable content: the exact affine
region models, the optimality lemmas, the effective-support reduction, the exact-gauge kernel
result, the "not affine" measurement of the boolean-to-residual map, the flat 5–6 cost profile
over discrete knobs, and every checker-verified score. None of those depend on the discarded
framing.

<summary>Withdrawn (historical record only)</summary>

### The finding that reframed the campaign

Agent I derives, from its own parse with each step reproducible, that the instance
**reduces exactly to a 256-bit ECDLP**: residual symbols trace to the short-Weierstrass
addition law after removing a K offset; the 512 conditional-pin constants lie on
`y^2 = x^3 + b`, a sextic twist of secp256k1 with prime 256-bit group order N; 185 of 219
table points have their double in the table, so the 256 selectors index a doubling ladder;
the instance asserts `k*G = P_target`. If step 6 of its chain holds — that there is no
mod-p freedom anywhere except the selector bits — then 39,026 is a **coding optimum, not a
near-miss**, and no search closes the remaining 7 equations.

Independent corroboration from agents that never shared a model: D's residual at 39,017 is
two mod-p pins on `(x3, y3)`; C reduces the system to three conditions; F confirms p is the
secp256k1 field prime with handles entering as `p*h`; A states the obstruction as two mod-p
congruences over 12 rank-7 rows.

### Surviving five, all retasked to falsify that claim from their own models

Independence is the point: none may import agent I's artifacts.

- **I** — harden the chain into a PASS/FAIL certificate; be adversarial about step 6, which
  is the only step carrying "unavoidable" rather than merely "present."
- **A** — are the two mod-p congruences the same object as the ECDLP? Does any integer
  combination escape them (HNF/enlargement)? An escape refutes step 6.
- **C** — decisive and cheap: in branch (1,1), set free inputs `x_22162, x_30213` to K2, K1
  and report the checker score. Closes the system, or breaks exactly as I predicts.
- **D** — did the search ever move `(x3, y3)` to a *different* valid curve point? Answerable
  from logs already held. If it moved freely, step 6 is wrong.
- **F** — independently verify N's primality (computed once, by one agent, via Cornacchia),
  and check for smooth/small-order structure. Also test the sharp prediction that lift
  obstructions concentrate at p alone.

A clean refutation would be the campaign's most valuable result; a clean confirmation lets
the situation be stated precisely instead of gestured at.

### Current tasking — after the withdrawal

All framing-dependent searches were stopped. The live work is algebraic and combinatorial,
and most of it needed no reframing because it was never framing-dependent:

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| A | ISD / coset-leader search on the mod9118_0 basin: 89 affine rows, 65 knobs, rank 65, Q-consistent with a unique non-integral solution, so every integer point's violated set must contain a code support. Report the minimum support weight observed. |
| C | Fix the settable classifier so it reproduces the deliverable's true cost of 7, then re-run globalscan over all 3,349 settable handle-definition atoms with corrected pricing |
| E | Pin-feasibility scan per bit, then subsets: do the pin conditions constrain subsets independently, or only through their sum? |
| F | Multi-modular: solve mod many primes and prime powers, locate where lift obstructions actually concentrate, then Hensel-lift and CRT-reconstruct |
| G | Minimum-weight coset decoding in the exact equation-level model (6,613 linear + 161 nonlinear equations, 4,652 unknowns) — the only model in the fleet posed at equation level rather than atom level |
| H | Integer relations among the 512 load-pin constants and the two residual congruences, using close2.py's constructive cascade closer rather than search |
| I | Maximize cancellation: min number of nonzero equations over atom vectors in the image of the atom map, seeded from a 2-atom cut |
| J | Second off-manifold coding: 2 nonzero atoms vs the deliverable's 7, choosing handle lifts into as many equation-row kernels as possible |

I and J attack the same formulation from different models and are barred from importing each
other's work; A, C and G attack adjacent versions of the placement question the same way.

### Check-in 3 — the central question is answered

The open question above — that "all atoms zero" is sufficient but not necessary, so every
optimality argument lived inside one branch — is **closed**, from two directions.

**F computed it directly.** For the 39,033 × 39,033 equation–atom incidence matrix M
(525,982 nonzeros): **rank(M) = 39,033, dim ker(M) = 0.** Two independent methods — a
characteristic-free peeling certificate re-verifiable from M on disk (all pivots ±1 or ±2,
none divisible by any odd prime, so it holds over ℤ and every field of char ≠ 2), and
Wiedemann over a word prime, validated on controls of known rank before use. Therefore *any*
assignment satisfying all 39,033 equations must make all 39,033 atoms exactly zero:
all-atoms-zero is an **equivalence, not a restriction**, and no frame-optimality result in
this lab still depends on it.

**A's equation-level bound survives, and is tight.** Asked whether it was exposed to the
vacuity J found in the raw relaxation, A checked its own formulation rather than defending
it: its code is {N·u} over knob directions, so realizability is in the construction. No
single-equation atom appears in any window, and none of the 3,235 in the instance carries a
private variable. The sharpened statement: **neither condition alone gives 7** — condition (b)
admits 582 weight-6 supports at L=6 and 62 at L=16, the mod-p filter kills every one, and 7
is exactly the lightest weight the filter admits. The bound is tight, not merely unbeaten.

**Convergent closure.** eq8680 — the single row costing the deliverable its seventh equation —
was reached independently four times: I from the equation side, J from row structure, H from
the free-input side, G from its equation-level model (where it is a binary quadratic form of
discriminant exactly 0, i.e. a perfect square pinning one linear relation for one equation).
I then closed it by complete enumeration over its 18 atoms; H proved no direction anywhere
moves a22231 without moving a37887, making it a 1-for-1 trade.

**J's synthesis of why everything failed:** the instance keeps its free content
**equation-disjoint** from its residual cluster. Zero of the 83 confined knobs, and zero of the
900 free-knob atoms, share even one equation with the deliverable's cluster. Six dead ends,
one property.

### Live tasking after check-in 3

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| A | Write THEOREM.md — the full statement, both conditions, tightness, and what is *not* proved (the L=344 affine ceiling) |
| C | Residue-aware pricer (structural pricing proved a dead instrument — no function of incidence structure alone can return 7) |
| E | The irreducible triple that every ≥2-bit subset reduces to |
| F | The two remaining conditional links — the **only** things between this lab and an unconditional result |
| G | Carry the span argument outward (enumeration stops being exhaustive past ~3e6 candidates) |
| H | Price all ~30 cascade pin atoms as alternative defect carriers |
| I | Finish the 66 pairs, then stop |
| J | The a23328 bridge — the one object not equation-disjoint from the residual |

**Limits at check-in 3:** 4 cores, load 17.3, 10 GB memory free, 29 GB disk, solve_lab 511 MB.
No limit near. Framing purge audited clean across all ten agent directories.

## THE INSTANCE, DECODED — read this before anything else

Agent F (`agentF_work/tree96.json`, `stage_law2.py`): **`EQUATIONS.txt` is a 96-stage binary
combination tree of depth 6 over 256 leaf constants.** A gate fires only when *both* its inputs
are live; with one live input the value passes straight through. Of the 72 stages with a full
six-tuple of free inputs, **all 72 obey the same degree-3 law with the same universal offset
constant — zero exceptions**, verified across every role partition and coordinate ordering with
two independent random draws required to agree. The remaining 24 are leaf-adjacent (one input
is a literal). One stage was decoded explicitly and its demanded output matched digit for digit.

**The task is: choose a subset of the 256 leaves whose fold through the fixed tree hits the
target at the root.** The space is exponential, not quadratic.

### The reversal that produced this

The campaign had converged on a floor of 7 from six directions with an infeasibility result
forming. F then **withdrew its own infeasibility argument**: its rigidity engine derived no
contradiction on same-tree selector pairs: instead an adder stopped being forced. That is an
accumulator, not a conflict. Had F defended the claim, this lab would have closed on a false
result and nobody would have looked for the tree.

**The standing caveat (agent E, written into `agentE_work/RESUME_E.md`)** — three independent
sightings in three frames: **the mod-p content of a row is not a property of the row; it is a
property of which selectors are on.** Coefficients, coprimality *and* the target residues all
move with configuration. Therefore **every mod-p rigidity / pinning / "coefficient divisible by
p" argument in this lab is conditional on a selector configuration that was not stated when the
argument was made**, and must be re-quoted with its configuration or it is not a claim about
the instance. This applies to results throughout `NOTEBOOK.md` and to several in this file.

**Broadened after E's fourth retraction — state your KNOB SET.** Four barriers were reported
and all four were retracted, every one caused by computing a property over a *filtered* knob
set and reporting it as a property of the instance: the triple (booleans excluded), §14
(affine-only), §15 (fixed residue multiset), §20 (dual-reaching knobs only — a knob moving just
one row is precisely an independent direction). The knob set, not the configuration, is the
variable that has actually been wrong every time. Any claim of the form "nothing can move X"
must state exactly which knobs were searched.

### What still stands unconditionally

- **ker(M) = 0** — rank 39,033 on the 39,033 × 39,033 incidence matrix, by three independent
  computations (peeling certificate over ℤ, re-verifiable from M on disk; Wiedemann at two
  distinct word primes). So all-atoms-zero is an *equivalence*: any full solution must make
  every atom vanish. Note agents' matrices differ in atom count (F 39,033, I 40,885, A 42,267)
  — compare decompositions before comparing kernel dimensions.
- **The deliverable: 39,026 / 39,033**, `best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`.
- **No infeasibility claim stands anywhere in this lab.**

### Verification rule

Some states carry values above Python's 4,300-digit cap, at which point **`checker.py` cannot
parse them and raises ValueError** — a bare "checker.py says" would be false. Use
`agentE_work/verifyE.py`, which raises only the digit cap and calls checker's own
`load_equations` / `load_assignment` / `evaluate_all` unmodified. Verified by the coordinator.

### Live tasking

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| F | Fold evaluator over `tree96.json`; **test whether the stage law inverts** — that single fact decides whether meet-in-the-middle makes the tree attackable |
| E | Find a second independent residue class reaching (a28647, a20215) — the 41 dual-reaching knobs form exactly *one* class, and one class cannot satisfy two independent congruences |
| H | Enumerate detach sets (1-, 2-, 3-subsets) — the last unvaried axis; carrier class, selector count, region shape and knob budget are all priced and closed |
| G | Carry the span argument outward |
| I | Finish the 66-pair sweep |

---

## FINAL POSITION (coordinator context exhausted — handoff)

**Deliverable: 39,026 / 39,033**, `best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`, failing
`[12231, 12270, 12350, 14584, 18673, 22044, 29125]`. No agent beat it.

### Established
- **The instance is a 96-stage binary tree of depth 6** over 256 leaf constants; one degree-3
  law with one universal constant across all 72 fully-determined stages, zero exceptions; the
  law is **invertible in closed form**. Reachable space = 2²⁵⁶ − 1 non-empty leaf subsets.
- **ker(M) = 0** (three independent computations) ⇒ all-atoms-zero is an *equivalence*.
- **Two independent derivations of the same problem.** F from the circuit: root slots carry
  leaf supports **178 | 78**. E from the residual congruences: channels **178 | 41 + 21 + 16**.
  Same split, no contact between them. E's caveat stands — that the 16 inert booleans become
  live at some configuration is a *prediction*, untested, so the match is suggestive not
  established.
- **Contributions saturate**: a channel contributes at most once however many of its bits are
  on — the residual-side form of "a gate passes its input through when only one input is live."

### Refuted (all by the agents that reported them)
- The **infeasibility argument** — withdrawn by its author. **No infeasibility claim stands.**
- **Five barriers**, four of them E's, every one from computing a property over a *filtered
  knob set* and reporting it as a property of the instance.
- The **"rank > deficit" criterion** — supplied by H, propagated by the coordinator, then
  refuted by H: it fires on 3,781 of 3,889 detach sets, all of which zero one row against the
  witness's five. **Integer reachability of row targets is the binding quantity, not rank.**

### Highest-value next experiment
Finish F's 56 undecoded slot pairs and the 24 leaf-adjacent literals; build the fold evaluator;
**validate on ON-set {24601, 2081}** (must predict the fold of those two leaves, *not* the
target); then invert the target down the 78-side chain through the 88- and 50-support stages to
a node of leaf support ≤ 24, enumerate forward, match under 2²⁴. The window is populated — 66 of
96 stages sit in 2..24 (`agentF_work/stage_profile.json`).

### Read these, in this order
`agentF_work/RESUME_F.md` (136 lines, self-contained) → `agentE_work/RESUME_E.md` (92 lines) →
`agentA_work/THEOREM.md` → each other `agent*_work/RESUME_*.md`.

### Two standing rules
1. **Verification**: states above 4,300 decimal digits cannot be parsed by `checker.py` — use
   `agentE_work/verifyE.py` (raises only the digit cap, calls checker's own loader/evaluator
   unmodified). A bare "checker.py says" is false for those states.
2. **Any claim of the form "nothing can move X" must state its knob set AND its selector
   configuration.** Both have been wrong, repeatedly, and both change the answer.
