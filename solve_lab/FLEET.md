# FLEET — multi-agent solver campaign: roster, stop policy, restart procedure

This file is written and owned by the **coordinator session**, not by any solver agent.
Solver agents must not modify it. It exists so the campaign can be stopped at a session
limit and restarted afterwards without losing work or re-deciding the plan.

## Roster (10 independent solvers)

Every agent: reads `PROMPT.txt` as its mission, re-verifies the 39,026 partial itself,
treats prior lab conclusions as hypotheses, writes only into its own directory, runs no
git commands, and verifies every claimed improvement with `solve_lab/checker.py`.

| Agent | Work dir | Angle |
|-------|----------|-------|
| A | `agentA_work/` | Exact integer linear algebra: HNF / Smith normal form, LLL / BKZ on the lift lattice; retest "39,026 is optimal" under a larger movable-variable set |
| B | `agentB_work/` | Independent re-parse of the raw file; own model, ignoring the lab's atom/gate decomposition |
| C | `agentC_work/` | SAT / SMT / CP / MIP and algebraic solver encodings of the reduced core |
| D | `agentD_work/` | Large-scale stochastic search; fast exact incremental evaluator, parallel tempering / LNS across multiple restart partials |
| E | `agentE_work/` | Structural attack on the 7 failing equations: exact dependency neighborhood, computed free deformation space, simultaneous repair |
| F | `agentF_work/` | p-adic and multi-modular lifting: solve mod many primes, Hensel-lift, CRT-reconstruct |
| G | `agentG_work/` | Relaxation and rounding: homotopy, SDP / moment, MIP relaxations as a compass, exact integer snapping |
| H | `agentH_work/` | Decomposition: dependency graph, separators, treewidth, block DP over a small separator |
| I | `agentI_work/` | Build from scratch rather than repair: complete CDCL-style search, hard variables decided at the top of the tree |
| J | `agentJ_work/` | Attack the reduced parameterization (the claimed thirteen 296-bit numbers); verify it first, then solve directly in that space |

**Forbidden for all agents:** reverse-engineering how the instance file was generated — no
PRNG or coefficient-template forensics, no emission-order or index-ordering forensics aimed
at recovering a generator. Agent E originally held that angle and was redirected; artifacts
it produced under it are withdrawn, not built upon. The equations are to be analyzed as
mathematical objects only.

## Binding limits (measured, not assumed)

| Resource | Measured | Status |
|----------|----------|--------|
| CPU | 4 cores, 10 agents | **BINDING** — ~2.5x oversubscribed |
| Memory | 15 GB total, ~12 GB available | ample |
| Disk | ~30 GB available; `solve_lab/` ~350 MB | ample |
| Coordinator context | grows with each agent report | the real session limit |

CPU is the near constraint, so agents are compute-starved rather than blocked. That is
acceptable for search-style work but means wall-clock results arrive slower than a 10x
fan-out suggests.

## Stop policy

A stop is *appropriate* only when the agent's work is already durable. Order matters:

1. Send each agent a flush request (`SendMessage`): write its findings to
   `agent<X>_work/LOG.md` and `agent<X>_work/RESUME_<X>.md`, save any verified assignment
   JSON, and report back — within one tool round.
2. Wait for the reports, or for a short grace period.
3. Only then `TaskStop` anything still running.
4. Coordinator commits and pushes all agent directories.
5. Update the "Campaign state" section below.

Never `TaskStop` first: agents hold their best results in context, and an un-flushed stop
discards exactly the work the campaign is for.

Under CPU pressure specifically, prefer **thinning the fleet** over stopping it — stop the
agents whose angle has plateaued and let the rest have the cores.

## Restart procedure (after a limit resets)

1. Read this file, then `RESUME.md` and `STATE.json`.
2. Re-verify the deliverable: `python3 solve_lab/checker.py solve_lab/best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`.
3. For each agent to resume: read its `agent<X>_work/RESUME_<X>.md`, then relaunch a fresh
   agent with the same angle from the roster above, pointing it at that file so it continues
   rather than restarts. Agent work dirs are committed, so a fresh container recovers them
   from the branch.
4. Do not relaunch an angle that reported a definitive dead end — record it under "Retired
   angles" below and spend the core elsewhere.

## Campaign state

- Best verified partial: **39,026 / 39,033**, `best/new_instance_partial_39026.json`,
  failing `[12231, 12270, 12350, 14584, 18673, 22044, 29125]`. **No agent has beaten it.**
- Retired angles: generator inversion (dropped by user instruction, agent E redirected).

### Check-in 1 — fleet thinned 10 → 5

CPU was 5x oversubscribed (load 20 on 4 cores), so five agents were stopped flush-first.
Memory and disk stayed ample. Stopped, each having delivered its angle's result:

| Agent | Why stopped | What it delivered |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| B | angle complete | independent parser + model, 0/39033 mismatches; every eq is `scalar * L^k = 0` |
| E | below baseline (39,015) | clean parse + acyclic DAG, 8,365 free inputs, after losing its first angle |
| G | superseded | exact symbolic forward eval over F_p: 112 symbols, 57 non-constant checks |
| H | decomposition delivered | acyclic frame over all 38,748 vars, 8,747 free inputs — cleaner than prior sessions' |
| J | verdict delivered | reduced parameterization independently re-derived and CONFIRMED real |

### WITHDRAWN BY USER INSTRUCTION — do not resume, do not re-derive

The section below records a reading of the instance that the user has directed the fleet to
drop entirely. All agents have been told to delete its artifacts, purge its vocabulary from
their notes, and not re-derive it. **It is retained here only so a future session recognizes
the direction as closed rather than rediscovering it.** Do not act on it, cite it, or use it
to argue that the instance is unsolvable.

The reason for the change is sound independently of whether the reading was correct: every
agent had begun interpreting every result through a single lens, and that lens was being used
to conclude the instance cannot be solved — which narrowed what anyone was willing to search.
Work the equations as integer polynomials.

Note what survives translation, because it is most of the durable content: the exact affine
region models, the optimality lemmas, the effective-support reduction, the exact-gauge kernel
result, the "not affine" measurement of the boolean-to-residual map, the flat 5–6 cost profile
over discrete knobs, and every checker-verified score. None of those depend on the discarded
framing.

### The finding that reframed the campaign

Agent I derives, from its own parse with each step reproducible, that the instance
**reduces exactly to a 256-bit ECDLP**: residual symbols trace to the short-Weierstrass
addition law after removing a K offset; the 512 conditional-pin constants lie on
`y^2 = x^3 + b`, a sextic twist of secp256k1 with prime 256-bit group order N; 185 of 219
table points have their double in the table, so the 256 selectors index a doubling ladder;
the instance asserts `k*G = P_target`. If step 6 of its chain holds — that there is no
mod-p freedom anywhere except the selector bits — then 39,026 is a **coding optimum, not a
near-miss**, and no search closes the remaining 7 equations.

Independent corroboration from agents that never shared a model: D's residual at 39,017 is
two mod-p pins on `(x3, y3)`; C reduces the system to three conditions; F confirms p is the
secp256k1 field prime with handles entering as `p*h`; A states the obstruction as two mod-p
congruences over 12 rank-7 rows.

### Surviving five, all retasked to falsify that claim from their own models

Independence is the point: none may import agent I's artifacts.

- **I** — harden the chain into a PASS/FAIL certificate; be adversarial about step 6, which
  is the only step carrying "unavoidable" rather than merely "present."
- **A** — are the two mod-p congruences the same object as the ECDLP? Does any integer
  combination escape them (HNF/enlargement)? An escape refutes step 6.
- **C** — decisive and cheap: in branch (1,1), set free inputs `x_22162, x_30213` to K2, K1
  and report the checker score. Closes the system, or breaks exactly as I predicts.
- **D** — did the search ever move `(x3, y3)` to a *different* valid curve point? Answerable
  from logs already held. If it moved freely, step 6 is wrong.
- **F** — independently verify N's primality (computed once, by one agent, via Cornacchia),
  and check for smooth/small-order structure. Also test the sharp prediction that lift
  obstructions concentrate at p alone.

A clean refutation would be the campaign's most valuable result; a clean confirmation lets
the situation be stated precisely instead of gestured at.

### Current tasking — after the withdrawal

All framing-dependent searches were stopped. The live work is algebraic and combinatorial,
and most of it needed no reframing because it was never framing-dependent:

| Agent | Task |
|-------|------|
| A | ISD / coset-leader search on the mod9118_0 basin: 89 affine rows, 65 knobs, rank 65, Q-consistent with a unique non-integral solution, so every integer point's violated set must contain a code support. Report the minimum support weight observed. |
| C | Fix the settable classifier so it reproduces the deliverable's true cost of 7, then re-run globalscan over all 3,349 settable handle-definition atoms with corrected pricing |
| E | Pin-feasibility scan per bit, then subsets: do the pin conditions constrain subsets independently, or only through their sum? |
| F | Multi-modular: solve mod many primes and prime powers, locate where lift obstructions actually concentrate, then Hensel-lift and CRT-reconstruct |
| G | Minimum-weight coset decoding in the exact equation-level model (6,613 linear + 161 nonlinear equations, 4,652 unknowns) — the only model in the fleet posed at equation level rather than atom level |
| H | Integer relations among the 512 load-pin constants and the two residual congruences, using close2.py's constructive cascade closer rather than search |
| I | Maximize cancellation: min number of nonzero equations over atom vectors in the image of the atom map, seeded from a 2-atom cut |
| J | Second off-manifold coding: 2 nonzero atoms vs the deliverable's 7, choosing handle lifts into as many equation-row kernels as possible |

I and J attack the same formulation from different models and are barred from importing each
other's work; A, C and G attack adjacent versions of the placement question the same way.

The open question that matters most, stated without any framing: **"all atoms zero" is
sufficient but not necessary.** 1,853 atoms occur in exactly one equation and the deliverable
itself carries 9 nonzero atoms, so every optimality argument this campaign has produced —
including two exhaustive ones — lives inside a single branch of the system. I's and J's
cancellation experiments are the probe of what lies outside it.
